`Logistic Regression` is widest known as a straightforward, simple, and reliable method to cast a binomial classification based on numerical
parameters. Since it is fundamental in machine learning and data science toolkits, it is paramount to consider their cons and pros, besides the situation where is suitable to use.

In this repository, you can find lessons from Logistic Regression Platzi course (https://platzi.com/cursos/regresion-logistica/). Final project is about to perform a binomial logistic analysis for widely recognized `Breast Cancer` dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), where a highly trust model was obtained.

### Advantages:

* Use to implement
* Interpretation metrics as linear regression
* Feature relevance inference
* Percent classification (binary: 0,1)
* Excellent results with linearly behaviored datasets.

### Disadvantages:

* It assumes linearity between codependent variables
* Overfitting in high dimensionality datasets
* Multicolinearity affects
* Better results with large datasets.

### When to use it?

* Simple and fast
* Occurence probability about a categorical event
* Large datasets
* Linearly separated
* Balanced (about 50-50 binary) datasets.
